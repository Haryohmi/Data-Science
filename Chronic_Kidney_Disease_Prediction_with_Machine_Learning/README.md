# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction with Machine Learning
Welcome to the CKD Prediction project, showcasing how data science and machine learning can drive early detection and improved management of Chronic Kidney Disease. Using the kidney_details.csv dataset, we complete the full pipeline—from data cleaning and transformation to training a high-performing XGBoost model.

# Project Overview
Goal: Detect CKD early, enabling personalized care and optimized resources.

Dataset: kidney_details.csv

# Model: 
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) for its speed and accuracy.

# Results
Accuracy: 98% on the test set

Reliability: Actual vs. Predicted labels strongly align, validating the model’s robustness.


# Conclusion
Our XGBoost model effectively identifies CKD vs. non-CKD cases, illustrating how machine learning can aid healthcare by:

- Supporting Decisions: Providing accurate early warnings
- Personalizing Treatment: Tailoring interventions based on risk
- Optimizing Resources: Prioritizing high-risk patients
- Scaling: Integrating seamlessly with existing healthcare systems
- Despite strong performance, continuous refinement is recommended. Future directions include exploring additional features, advanced imputation methods, or ensemble models for even greater accuracy.
