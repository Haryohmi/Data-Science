# Mastering Bank Churn Prediction
Practical Insights into Preprocessing, Model Building, and Predictive Modeling

# Overview
This project tackles one of the most critical challenges in banking: predicting customer churn. By leveraging data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning models, and hyperparameter tuning, we aim to pinpoint customers most likely to exit and offer strategies to retain them.

# Key Achievements
- Comprehensive Data Pipeline
  - Data Cleaning to remove outliers and handle missing values.
- Feature Engineering (label encoding, scaling, and SMOTE oversampling) for balanced and meaningful input.
- Robust Model Comparison
  - Logistic Regression: 72.12% accuracy
  - SVM: 76.95% accuracy
  - Random Forest: 89.92% accuracy; Precision ~0.91, Recall ~0.88, F1 ~0.90
- Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Randomized Search refined Random Forest hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Feature Importance Analysis
- Top drivers for churn include Age, Number of Products, Balance, and IsActiveMember.

# Feasible Impact
- Retention Strategies
Identify high-risk customers early and implement retention plans (e.g., targeted campaigns, loyalty offers).
- Cost Savings
Reduce the expense of customer acquisition by focusing on loyal customers.
- Personalized Banking
Leverage insights (e.g., age, product usage) to customize offerings and build stronger customer relationships.

# Future Work
- Additional Feature Extraction (e.g., transaction patterns, credit activity).
- Ensemble Methods (Stacking, Gradient Boosting ensembles) for even higher accuracy.
- AutoML or Deep Learning for automated hyperparameter tuning and hidden feature discovery.
- Deployment via a web API or real-time dashboard for ongoing churn monitoring.
